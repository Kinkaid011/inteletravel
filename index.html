          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            InteleTravel's website was initial primary goal was to attract new
            travel advisors for recruitment purposes. This strategic focus on
            building a robust network of independent, home-based advisors
            brought great success, significantly contributing to the expansion
            of InteleTravel's advisor community. However, as market dynamics and
            consumer behaviors evolved, InteleTravel recognized the need to
            adapt its approach to keep pace with the changing travel industry
            landscape.
